<hr />
<h2 id="about">What is Community Life Engagement? </h2>
<p>Community Life Engagement refers to the ways people with IDD access and participate in their communities outside of employment, and the supports that enable such engagement. This can include volunteer work; postsecondary, adult, or continuing education; accessing community facilities such as the library, gym, or recreation center; and any activities that people with and without disabilities do in their spare time. </p>

<p>Community Life Engagement is sometimes is referred to as Community Based Day or Community-Based Non-Work (CBNW). It may be used to support career exploration, wrap around work time, or serve as a retirement option.</p>
