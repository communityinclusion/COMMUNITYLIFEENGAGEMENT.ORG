<h1>Community Life Engagement</h1>

<hr />
<p><strong>Community Life Engagement is a research and technical assistance project. Through it, we examine what people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) are doing to be involved in their communities outside of employment. </p>

<p>The primary goal of this project is the development, implementation, and field-testing of two toolkits &emdash; one for state agency personnel and one for community rehabilitation providers (CRPs). Both toolkits support the design and development of high-quality Community Life Engagement services. </strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="about">What is Community Life Engagement? </h2>
<p>Community Life Engagement refers to the ways people with IDD access and participate in their communities outside of employment, and the supports that enable such engagement. This can include volunteer work; postsecondary, adult, or continuing education; accessing community facilities such as the library, gym, or recreation center; and any activities that people with and without disabilities do in their spare time. </p>

<p>Community Life Engagement is sometimes is referred to as Community Based Day or Community-Based Non-Work (CBNW). It may be used to support career exploration, wrap around work time, or serve as a retirement option.</p>

<p>Prior research and development activities
<ul>
<li>Beginning in 1996, the Institute for Community Inclusion (ICI) added a Community-Based Non-Work category to the National Survey of Day and Employment Programs for People with IDD </li>
<li>In 2004-2005, ICI staff conducted case studies of Community-Based Non-Work at six CRPs in two states.   </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="current">Current Research and Development Activities</h2>

<p>The project will:</p>
<li>Form a Community of Practice to identify emerging issues and needs at the state level, in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.selnmembers.org/">State Employment Leadership Network</a>.</li>
<li>Conduct expert interviews with 12-15 knowledgeable people representing state IDD agencies, CRPs, researchers, family members, and individuals with IDD. </li>
<li>Develop a promising practices series on state agency and CRP-level implementation of Community Life Engagement.</li>
<li>Conduct case studies of effective Community Life Engagement efforts by CRPs.</li>
<li>Survey state IDD agencies about their Community Life Engagement policies and practices.</li>
<li>Develop, pilot, and disseminate guideposts and toolkits for state agency personnel and CRPs.</li>
